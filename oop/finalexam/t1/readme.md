Description:
This program performs operations on three lists.

Step 1 - Build list3:
- For each value in list1:
    - Get the value at that index from list2.
    - Increment the index by one.
    - Concatenate the incremented number with the string from list2.
    - Insert the result at the same index in list3.

Step 2 - Modify list3 (Error handling):
- Sort list1.
- For each index in sorted list1:
    - If the index is valid (within bounds of list3), remove the element.
    - Otherwise, do nothing.
